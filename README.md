I wrote this program after re-learning Python.

It uses google selenium to connect to a web-page, scrape some content, and email that content to an address.

ABC news is hard-coded into it, cause I had to pick a website, and it can scrape and email the top daily headlines.

Some boilerplate code was used from these sites:
	https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-course/
	https://realpython.com/python-send-email/

But most of the code is mine :)
